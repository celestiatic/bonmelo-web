## How it works

Bonmelo is a future-ready feature-packed chatting platform. Our aim is to give users a fun and easy experience using Bonmelo.

**Architecture**

Bonmelo is a [hosted platform](https://chat.bonmelo.com). You can sign up and start using Bonmelo without doing anything extra.
You can also [self-host bonmelo](https://docs.bonmelo.com/guides/hosting/overview) and [develop locally](https://docs.bonmelo.com/guides/local-development).
Most of Bonmelo is built on top of [Supabase](https://supabase.com).

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is an object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
- [Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/auth) is a complete User Management system that works without any additional tools.
- [Supabase Storage](https://supabase.com/storage) is an open source Object store with unlimited scalability, for any file type.

#### Client libraries

Our approach for client libraries is modular. Each sub-library is a standalone implementation for a single external system. This is one of the ways we support existing tools.

**‚ö°Ô∏è Official ‚ö°Ô∏è**
- [Bonmelo.js](https://github.com/celestiatic/bonmelo.ts) - a ready-to-use typescript-based client for both javascript and typescript.
